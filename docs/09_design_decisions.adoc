== Design Decisions
Regarding the design decisions made by the team, we have the following:

* Use of React to develop the front-end of the application. We chose this technology because of the wide support available due to its high usage in the job market and on the internet. This is also an incentive for us to learn this technology, which may be useful in our future careers.
    
* Use of Node.js for the development, execution, and deployment of the back-end of the project. We made this decision for similar reasons as the choice of React - it is a widely used technology with high support and is ideal for running JavaScript code quickly and easily.

We have many more decisions to make regarding the implementation and functionality of the application, but these decisions will be made later, and we will update this section to reference all those decisions made throughout the development of the project.
