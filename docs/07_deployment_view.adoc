Motivation::

Access to the application will be through web browsers from users' devices.

The application is divided into 2 modules: Frontend and Backend.

The Frontend is the interface with which users interact.

The Backend manages the logic of the application and the access to the data.

It is pending to decide on which platform or platforms the frontend and backend of the application will be deployed.

Quality and/or Performance Features::

Deployment in the cloud has advantages over an on-premises solution (software deployed on hardware located at the client's premises, in this case the Brussels City Council):
* Scalability. By working with virtualized hardware in the cloud, the system can be easily scaled, even automatically in the face of increased demand.
* Availability. Cloud platforms guarantee high availability that can be established through a service level agreement.
* Security. Cloud platforms have hundreds of engineers dedicated exclusively to security.

Mapping of Building Blocks to Infrastructure::
Deployment
To deploy the project we have two options, deploy it locally or through a web hosting service.


|===
| Type of hosting        | Characteristics
| Local | You can throw the app with a local server in  your own computer.
| Web service    | Used to host the application on a remote server, Servicio que sirve para alojar la aplicaci√≥n en un servidor remoto, there are a lot of services to host, being able to make the application accessible to other people.
