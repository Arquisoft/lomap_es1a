| *Term*  | *Definition*
| User    | Represents the users of the application. A user will be able to manage from the application what information is shared with other users (contacts). To facilitate permission management, contacts can be grouped into groups.
| Map     | Simplified graphic representation of the city of Brussels. The application will make it possible to have personalized maps of places and businesses in the city. Users will be able to add places to the map in different categories.
| Group   | Set of users. The application user can interact with other users (contacts). Contacts are allowed to be organized into user groups (friends, relatives, etc). A user can create as many groups as he wants. A contact is allowed to be part of multiple groups.
| Place   | Represents the physical location on the map of an element of interest to the user: a monument, a restaurant, etc. The same place can appear on different maps associated with the same user or with different users.
| Opinion | Information linked to a place generated and managed by the user: photos, comments, score, etc.

=== User requirements
The application is easy to use, it is not necessary to have previous knowledge, but as is logical, if the user is already familiar with the use of maps and social media is better. 
The only requirement is that the user need a POD account to use the application, but its not too difficult


=== Security
The application is secure because we use the SOLID principles, that means that every user data will be stored in his POD, so the information will be saved externally.

=== Operative Concepts
The basic operations that we can do in this application are:

- User authentication: Refers to identifying oneself in the application as a registered user through their POD.
- Put a mark on the map: The user will be able to place a point on the map by clicking on it, and a form for that point will appear.
- Saving a location with data in the POD: when filling out the form and clicking on submit, that information is saved in the user's POD.
- Filter by categories: A function that allows the user to see specific types of locations more precisely.
