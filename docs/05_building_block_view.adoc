Motivation::

Each user will have access to a personal POD in which they will be able to store locations and opinions, as well as to
share them to the rest of the userbase. These PODs guarantee that the user's data will be safely secured.

Contained Building Blocks::

[cols="1,3" options="header"]
|===
| *Name* | *Responsibility*
| User        | Client who will make use of the application.
| POD         | Stores the user's data.
| Application | Will exchange info between user and POD.
|===

Important Interfaces::

These will be determined as the application is developed.

=== Level 2

The application itself will be designed with the Model-view-controller (MVC) architectural pattern. As such, webapp will
be divided in three layers:

[cols="1,3" options="header"]
|===
| *Name* | *Description*
| Model      | Internal logic of the application, it sends info to the controller and to the PODs so it can function correctly.
| View       | What the user of the application will see.
| Controller | Allows the model layer and the view layer to communicate with each other.
|===
